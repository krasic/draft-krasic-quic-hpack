In the case of server response headers, the client has already closed the stream; in the case of server push streams, the stream is unidirectional.\r\n\r\nThis changes the HEADER_ACK to be sent on the control stream and use the variable-length encoding used by other HTTP/QUIC frames.  (I considered using an HPACK 8-bit prefix integer, but that requires reading one byte at a time to find the end of the frame.  The length of a QUIC varint can be determined immediately from the first byte, which is somewhat preferable.)"
